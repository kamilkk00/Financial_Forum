## Application Overview:

This online forum was designed with the idea of sharing knowledge among experienced individuals or specialists in their respective fields (such as tax advisors, accountants, and others).

Financial Forum is a web application based on the Django framework.  
The forum is intended to serve two types of users.  
The first group consists of people seeking knowledge in a specific area related to running a business. These users will be able to find articles of interest to them. They will also have the ability to view the profile of the person who created the article and potentially gain additional information about them, such as a website or phone number, which would allow them to access an expert in the relevant field.  
The second group consists of specialists who want to share their knowledge. If these individuals provide advisory services (e.g., accounting), they can upgrade their profile to a professional user, where they can provide information about their experience and basic details. After reading an article, users may be interested in using the services of that advisor.

The platform offers many features, such as creating professional profiles with details about experience. All posts can be saved, and authors can edit them. Additionally, there is the option to comment on and like both posts and comments.  
Likes play an important role as they determine the ranking on the homepage.  
Users can also search for articles of interest based on categories or keywords, both by title and content.  
Professional profiles also allow users to leave reviews, including satisfaction ratings (from 1 to 5).
